That the lives people are able to construct differ enormously across
the globe is a commonplace. In our age of travel, it is even a
common sight. That Becky and Desta face widely different futures is
also something we have come to expect, perhaps also to accept.
Nevertheless, it may not be out of turn to imagine that the girls are
intrinsically very similar. They both enjoy playing, eating, and
gossiping; they are close to their families; they turn to their mothers
when in distress; they like pretty things to wear; and they both have
the capacity to be disappointed, get annoyed, be happy.

Their parents are also alike. They are knowledgeable about the ways
of their worlds. They also care about their families, finding
ingenious ways to meet the recurring problem of producing income
and allocating resources among family members – over time and
allowing for unexpected contingencies. So, a promising route for
exploring the underlying causes behind their vastly different
conditions of life would be to begin by observing that the
opportunities and obstacles the families face are very different, that 
in some sense Desta’s family are far more restricted in what they are
able to be and do than Becky’s.</p style='margin-top:30px;'>
