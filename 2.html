Economics in great measure tries to uncover the processes that
influence how people’s lives come to be what they are. The
discipline also tries to identify ways to influence those very
processes so as to improve the prospects of those who are hugely
constrained in what they can be and do. The former activity involves
finding explanations, while the latter tries to identify policy
prescriptions. Economists also make forecasts of what the
conditions of economic life are going to be; but if the predictions are
to be taken seriously, they have to be built on an understanding of
the processes that shape people’s lives; which is why the attempt to
explain takes precedence over forecasting.

<p>
The context in which explanations are sought or in which
prescriptions are made could be a household, a village, a district, a
country, or even the whole world – the extent to which people or
places are aggregated merely reflects the details with which we
choose to study the social world. Imagine that we wish to
understand the basis on which food is shared among household
members in a community. Household income would no doubt be
expected to play a role; but we would need to look inside
households if we are to discover whether food is allocated on the
basis of age, gender, and status. If we find that it is, we should ask
why they play a role and what policy prescriptions, if any, commend
themselves. In contrast, suppose we want to know whether the
world as a whole is wealthier today than it was 50 years ago. As the
question is about global averages, we would be justified in ironing
out differences within and among households.</p style='margin-top:30px;'>
